## ðŸš€ **How to Test:**

1. **Build the application:**

   ```bash
   cd /home/kashif/Form-Pulse
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the features:**
   - Login as an admin user
   - Navigate to User Management
   - Create a new user - credentials modal should appear
   - Copy credentials using the copy buttons
   - Test that non-admin users cannot access user management
   - Verify login works without email verification
